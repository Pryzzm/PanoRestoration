Panola Mountain, a state park in central Georgia, has a grassland floodplain on its east side that used to be a cattle farm. A grassland restoration project has been in place since 2001. There is data to indicate how this restoration has gone, with butterfly observations from before the restoration and after, planst transects, and an ongoing bird banding station. 

With this I have analyzed the data to determine the effectiveness of the restoration effort with the help of the contributors listed above.
